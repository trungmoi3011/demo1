# Calculator with Unit Testing in Java

This project demonstrates how to create a simple `Calculator` class in Java and write unit tests using **JUnit 5**. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two integers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second integer from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two integers.
- **Division**: Divides the first integer by the second. Throws an exception if division by zero occurs.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **JUnit 5** for unit testing
- **NetBeans IDE** for project development (can also use IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse)
